# RP_TNB_Coast_Beta
### An older build of TNB's coast map amalgamation with the train yard

This is a previous version of the TnB compilation coast map used on their HL2RP servers.

You may ask, "why upload an old version?" To which I would direct you to the multitude of people requesting the train yard segment that was removed in the final version for one reason or another.
Things to note: This is a pre-release build. At this point, neither myself, nor Rowtree are responsible for any potential errors in the map.

Additionally, unless you specifically want the trainyard segment, I would endorse the official version over this one. While they do not conflict, I would advise the official over this one, as it is the final build, and likely has more under the hood tweaks that might make it better.
